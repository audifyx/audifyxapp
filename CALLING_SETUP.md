# Free Calling Feature Setup

Your Audifyx app now includes a **completely free calling system** with the following features:

## 🎉 Features Included
- ✅ **Audio Calls** - High-quality voice calls
- ✅ **Video Calls** - Video calls with camera support
- ✅ **Call History** - Track all your calls with duration and status
- ✅ **Real-time Signaling** - Using Supabase real-time for instant connectivity
- ✅ **Incoming Call UI** - Beautiful incoming call modal with ringtone
- ✅ **Call Controls** - Mute, speaker, video on/off, end call
- ✅ **Cross-device Sync** - Call history syncs across all devices
- ✅ **Haptic Feedback** - Native vibration feedback for calls

## 🗄️ Database Setup Required

To enable the calling feature, you need to run the SQL commands in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard** → Go to your project at https://supabase.com
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor** → Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. **Copy and paste the SQL from** → `src/database/calls-schema.sql`
4. **Run the SQL** → Click "Run" to create the calling tables

The SQL will create:
- `calls` table - Stores call records and history
- `call_signals` table - Handles real-time signaling for calls
- Proper indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for privacy
- Auto-cleanup functions for old signals

## 🚀 How It Works

### Making Calls
1. Go to **Call tab** in the app
2. Browse **Contacts** to see all users
3. Tap the **green phone icon** for audio call
4. Tap the **blue video icon** for video call
5. Call connects through Supabase real-time

### Receiving Calls
1. **Incoming call modal** appears automatically
2. **Accept** (green) or **Decline** (red) the call
3. **Haptic feedback** and ringtone alerts you
4. **Auto-decline** after 30 seconds if no answer

### Call Features
- **Mute/Unmute** - Toggle microphone
- **Video On/Off** - Toggle camera (video calls)
- **Speaker** - Switch to speakerphone
- **End Call** - Hang up the call

## 📊 Call History
- All calls are automatically saved
- View **Recent** calls in the Call tab
- Shows **duration**, **call type**, and **status**
- **Missed calls** are highlighted in red
- **Successful calls** show actual duration

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Supabase Real-time** - For call signaling and notifications
- **Expo AV** - For audio recording and playback
- **Zustand** - State management for call status
- **React Native Reanimated** - Smooth animations
- **Haptic Feedback** - Native vibration support

### Security
- **Row Level Security** - Users can only see their own calls
- **Authentication Required** - Must be signed in to make calls
- **Privacy Protection** - Call data is encrypted in transit

## 💡 Why This is Better Than Paid Services

Most calling services charge monthly fees or per-minute rates. This implementation:

- ✅ **Completely Free** - No monthly costs or usage limits
- ✅ **No Third-party Dependencies** - Uses your existing Supabase
- ✅ **Full Control** - You own all the call data
- ✅ **Scalable** - Grows with your user base
- ✅ **Privacy First** - No data shared with external services

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Tables not found" error
- Make sure you ran the SQL from `src/database/calls-schema.sql`
- Check your Supabase project permissions

### Calls not connecting
- Verify your Supabase real-time is enabled
- Check your network connection
- Make sure both users are online

### No incoming call notifications
- Check that the app has microphone permissions
- Ensure notifications are enabled for the app
- Verify the user is signed in properly

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

The foundation is now built for:
- **Group calls** (3+ participants)
- **Screen sharing** during video calls
- **Call recording** (with user consent)
- **WebRTC integration** for even better quality
- **Push notifications** for offline users
