# 🚀 How to Run EAS Workflows

## Current Status ✅

Your music social platform now has complete EAS workflow automation configured:

### ✅ Workflows Created:
1. **`create-production-builds.yml`** - Production app builds
2. **`development-builds.yml`** - Automatic dev builds  
3. **`update-production.yml`** - Over-the-air updates

3. **Select a workflow**
4. **Click "Run workflow"**
5. **Choose options and run**

### Option 2: Local EAS CLI

When working locally with EAS CLI installed:

```bash
# Install EAS CLI globally
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Login to your Expo account
eas login

# Run production builds
eas build --platform all --profile production

# Run development builds
eas build --platform all --profile development

# Push OTA updates
eas update --branch production --message "Bug fixes and improvements"

# Submit to app stores
eas submit --platform all --latest
```
